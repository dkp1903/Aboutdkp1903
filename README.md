This is a precis about all that I do, aspire and attempt. Blatant that I am, I made this so that all the potential recruiters who checkout my GitHub profile don't waste their precious time scavenging through a whole lot of repositories trying to make sense of what I want with life, so I went the extra mile of jotting it all down here, or all that I could think of.


I am Dushyant, from DA-IICT, Gandhingar, India, a Third year student in BTech Information and Communication Technology

While some say that it is a bad thing, I love multi tasking, and my GitHub has to face the backlash of my multitasking overdoses, overflowing with forked repositories, my own creations that lie around without Readme's. But all in all, this gives me a sense of purpose, and makes me feel like I am doing something right in my endeavors.

I am a competitive coding enthusiast, a professional Android Developer, a dabbling Full Stack Web Developer and am in love with Machine Learning, and all that I could do with it. Sounds too much to do, well yeah, it is, but I do like to keep myself busy.

I am preparing for Google Summer of Code '2020, in either Machine Learning or Android Development.
